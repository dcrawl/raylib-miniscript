# Plugins

Drop a folder here to add native intrinsics to the engine.  Everything under
`plugins/` is compiled into the one engine binary; adding a plugin needs no
change to `CMakeLists.txt` or `src/main.cpp`.  Re-run CMake (`cmake -S . -B build`)
after adding or removing a folder.

```
plugins/mything/
  plugin.cpp     required: defines the hooks below
  plugin.cmake   optional: include dirs, defines, libraries
  *.cpp *.h      any other sources are picked up automatically
```

The folder name must be a valid C identifier and unique (`plugins` is reserved). `plugin.cpp`
contains one `MS_PLUGIN(name, version, init, update, reset, shutdown)` line naming its hooks;
pass `nullptr` for any you don't need (only `init` is required):

```cpp
#include "Plugin.h"

static void Fill(MiniScript::ValueDict& m) { /* m.SetValue(String("fn"), f.GetFunc()); */ }

static bool Init() {                       // once, at interpreter creation
    PluginAddModule<&Fill>("mything");
    return true;                           // false: unavailable on this run
}
static void Update()   { }                 // every frame, main thread
static void Reset()    { }                 // before the script (re)starts
static void Shutdown() { }                 // app closing (reverse load order)

MS_PLUGIN(mything, "1.0", Init, Update, Reset, Shutdown)
```

Because the compiler, not the build system, decides which hooks exist, they can sit inside
`#ifdef` blocks, with `nullptr` in their place in the `MS_PLUGIN` line:

```cpp
MS_PLUGIN(mything, "1.0", Init,
#ifdef PLATFORM_DESKTOP
    Update,
#else
    nullptr,
#endif
    nullptr, Shutdown)
```
(To leave a whole plugin out on a platform, set `MS_PLUGIN_SKIP` in `plugin.cmake` instead.)

### When init fails
An SDK often can't start (Steam isn't running, the app wasn't launched from Steam).  Have `init`
return `false`: the engine logs a warning, never calls the plugin's other hooks, and marks it
unavailable.  Clean up after your own partial setup before returning false.

### Telling scripts what loaded
A global `plugins` map lists every plugin that was built in, so one script can ship to Steam, itch
and web and branch cleanly:
```
if plugins.hasIndex("steam") and plugins.steam.loaded then steam.unlock "FIRST_WIN"
print plugins.quadtree.version        // "1.0"
```
Each entry is `{"loaded": 1 or 0, "version": "..."}`.  A plugin left out of the build isn't listed.

See `quadtree/plugin.cpp` for a complete example, and `quadtree/test.ms` for a test script
(`./build/raylib-miniscript plugins/quadtree/test.ms`).

## plugin.cmake

Runs in the top-level scope, with `PLUGIN_NAME` and `PLUGIN_DIR` set, after the
platform sections of `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
if(EMSCRIPTEN)
    set(MS_PLUGIN_SKIP TRUE)                  # leave this plugin out on web
else()
    target_compile_definitions(raylib-miniscript PRIVATE MYTHING_ENABLED)
    target_include_directories(raylib-miniscript PRIVATE ${PLUGIN_DIR}/sdk/include)
    target_link_libraries(raylib-miniscript ${PLUGIN_DIR}/sdk/libmything.a)  # no PRIVATE/PUBLIC
endif()
```

Leave plugins out of a build with `-DMS_DISABLE_PLUGINS="mything;other"`.

## Plugins outside this repo

Some SDKs (Steamworks, most ad and purchase SDKs) can't be redistributed in a public tree.  Keep
those plugins in a private repo or git submodule, laid out like `plugins/` (a folder per plugin), and
point the build at it:

```
cmake -S . -B build -DMS_EXTRA_PLUGIN_DIRS="/path/to/private-plugins;../another"
```
(or set the `MS_EXTRA_PLUGIN_DIRS` environment variable; relative paths start at the repo root).  Names
must be unique across all directories.  A Steam-style `plugin.cmake` would copy the redistributable
(`steam_api64.dll`, `libsteam_api.so`, `libsteam_api.dylib`) next to the executable in a POST_BUILD
step, set the rpath on Linux and macOS, and write `steam_appid.txt` for development builds.

`scripts/gen_doc.ms` documents external plugins too (run it with the same `MS_EXTRA_PLUGIN_DIRS` set),
writing each one's `API.md` but adding no link to the public `API_DOC.md`.

## Documenting your plugin

`scripts/gen_doc.ms` writes your plugin's API into `plugins/<name>/API.md` (and adds a link
to it in `API_DOC.md`).  It finds your functions from the `SetValue(String("fn"), f.GetFunc())`
lines in the function you pass to `PluginAddModule`, so keep that shape.  The "Purpose" column
comes from the comment directly above each `Intrinsic::Create`.

The generated table sits between `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED API -->` and `<!-- END GENERATED API -->`
markers.  Write your own notes (setup, caveats, examples) anywhere outside them: reruns replace
only what is between the markers.  Run it from the repo root: `./build/raylib-miniscript scripts/gen_doc.ms`.

## Guidance

- Register under your own module name (`PluginAddModule`), so you can't clobber core intrinsics.
- Batch work: let a script make one native call for many items, not one per item.
- Keep native objects in GC handles with a finalizer (see `NewNativeHandle` in `src/RaylibTypes.h`).
- Async SDK results (purchases, ads, Steam callbacks) must never touch the VM from another thread.
  Push plain C++ structs onto a `PluginEventQueue<T>` (`src/PluginEvents.h`; thread-safe, bounded) from the
  SDK's callback, and have a script-callable `poll` return them with `PluginDrainEvents`, which builds
  the MiniScript maps on the main thread.  Pump the SDK itself (e.g. `SteamAPI_RunCallbacks`) in your update hook.
- A `Value` you keep across frames (a stored callback, a cached map) must be GC-rooted: hold it in a
  `PluginRooted` (also in `src/PluginEvents.h`), or call `GCManager::AddRoot` yourself.
- Never grant an in-app purchase entitlement on the client's "purchase succeeded" callback alone;
  verify the receipt on a server (the `http` module can make that call).
- Log through raylib (`TraceLog(LOG_INFO / LOG_WARNING / LOG_ERROR, "MYTHING: ...", ...)`), not `printf`, so plugin messages follow the engine's log level and callback.
- Guard platform-specific code with `PLATFORM_DESKTOP` / `PLATFORM_WEB`.
- Plugins are trusted code: they run in-process with full access, outside the file-system sandbox.
